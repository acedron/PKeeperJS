â€‹	This app was only for a challenge to finish a similar password keeper app before **[Cargamoni/PasswordKeeper](https://github.com/Cargamoni/PasswordKeeper)** using Electron, while keeping it slightly different. This means this repository is not going to be updated in the future, or issues won't be fixed. ***Use at your own risk!***

## Installation

Executables are available at **[releases page](https://github.com/acedron/PKeeperJS/releases/latest)**.
